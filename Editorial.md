Hint:
First calculate the number of days left before the final event and then total number of hours the instructor is putting in through the data given. Apply conditional statements according to the question for salary and number of hours comparison to get the answer.

Tutorial:
1) Firstly write the code to take the various inputs needed in the problem. Use of structures is helpful for large number of inputs.
2) Make a function to calculate the number of days left before the final event, switch statement can be used for this purpose as it has constant time complexity. 
3) Make an array to store the number of hours instructors can put in. (Number of hours = number of days left * number of hours per day instructor can put in).
4) Now iteratively, with linear time complexity find the minimum salary instructor, after having passed the minimum number of hours criteria, this will require the use of minima concept. If that comes to be more than one than look for the one who does more practise. 
5) Then print the serial number of the best suited instructor, we found through all these steps. 

Motivation:
I attended the indepedence day celebration and enjoyed the cultutral events preformed by the students. There this idea struck that how the practise would have taken place. How many hours and days were required for this excellent performnace and so I made this program to get the result fast and efficient.
